# **Qb** Drone

## Description

A sample, fully functional drone added to Risk of Rain 2.

The drone is powered by the API of **[Chen's Gradius Mod](https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/RoR2-ChensGradiusMod)**.

#### What is this?

A very mysterious drone of unknown origins. It is literally a cube that floats.

There is a model name and number on an edge that says...

**Qb.729.216.8 - "Cute Cube"**.

That is all we know about it.

#### Actions

**Lob Grenades** - It seems to form grenades from one of its central nodes and lobs them. The grenades are armed, so stay clear out of it.

**Close-Proximity Bomb Thing** - It seems to shoot fireballs that explode on contact. It only does so to nearby hostiles with uncanny accuracy.

**Mayhem Salvo** - It has a weird behavior of generating rockets, missiles and mines combined at such a fast rate, all coming out from all of its nodes. This lasts for quite some time. The immense firepower is impressive.

## Installation

Use **[Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)** to install this mod.

If one does not want to use a mod manager, then get the DLL from **[Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/Chen/Qb/)**.
